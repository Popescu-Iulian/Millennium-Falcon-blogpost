				Millennium Falcon - The history of the fastest hunk of junk in the Star
				Wars galaxy
			</h1>
			<p><i>Posted on November 15, 2019</i></p>
			<h2>A few things about <em>Millennium Falcon</em></h2>
			<p>
				Despite her humble origins and shabby exterior, the Millennium Falcon
				has played a role in some of the greatest victories of the Rebel
				Alliance and the New Republic. The Falcon looks like a worn-out junker,
				but beneath her hull she’s full of surprises. A succession of owners,
				including Lando Calrissian and Han Solo, have made special modifications
				that boosted the freighter’s speed, shielding and firepower to
				impressive – and downright illegal – levels. The price of such
				tinkering? The Falcon can be unpredictable, with her hyperdrive
				particularly balky. Despite her flaws, she’s beloved by her owners – Han
				Solo and Chewbacca spent years searching the galaxy for the ship they
				once called home, rejoicing when they finally reclaimed her.
			</p>
			<h2>History</h2>
			<h3><i>The Dark Times</i></h3>
			<p>
				The Millennium Falcon was Lando Calrissian’s pride and joy. After he
				acquired the Corellian freighter, Lando spared no expense remodeling it
				according to his discerning tastes. Extensive modifications made the
				Falcon an ideal home base for a sophisticated “sportsman” like Lando,
				who traveled the galaxy with pilot droid L3-37.
			</p>
			<p>
				The promise of a hefty percentage persuaded Lando to hire out his prized
				ship for a raid on Kessel’s coaxium supply. It was a decision Lando
				would come to regret.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the mining colony erupted in a mass breakout, Han Solo took the
				helm to complete the galaxy’s most famous Kessel Run. The glory of the
				achievement came at a crippling cost. By the time the Falcon touched
				down on Savareen, it was in worse shape than when Lando had first found
				the crude freighter. The journey had stripped away the immaculate
				streamlined plating, the auxiliary craft had been lost, and Lando soon
				retreated, limping away in what remained of his crowning achievement.
			</p>
			<p>
				But Han tracked Lando down on Numidian Prime, where he won the ship in a
				game of sabacc. For many years, the freighter served as home base as Han
				and Chewbacca began their smuggling careers.
			</p>
			<h3><i>Galactic Civil War</i></h3>
			<p>
				When Obi-Wan Kenobi hired Han Solo and Chewbacca for a charter to
				Alderaan, the Jedi specified that he needed a fast ship. Han assured him
				he’d found one -- hadn’t the Millennium Falcon made the Kessel Run in
				less than 12 parsecs? When Luke Skywalker first saw the battered
				freighter, he was convinced they’d been hoodwinked -- the Falcon looked
				like she might fall apart in her docking bay. But the Falcon lived up to
				her captain’s boasts, escaping the Imperial warships guarding Tatooine
				and proving maneuverable and tough in a firefight with TIE fighters
				patrolling space around the Death Star. Han and Chewie were at the
				Falcon’s controls when they blasted Darth Vader and his TIE wingmen off
				Luke’s tail, giving the young Rebel the chance to make the
				million-to-one shot that destroyed the Death Star.
			</p>
			<p>
				Han decided to leave his friends with the Rebel Alliance and pay off his
				debt to Jabba the Hutt, but the Falcon wouldn’t cooperate -- he and
				Chewbacca spent hours in Echo Base’s hangar trying to get the balky
				freighter back in flying shape. Han barely got the Falcon off the
				ground, escaping Hoth just ahead of Darth Vader’s shock troops, but her
				hyperdrive failed with Star Destroyers and TIE fighters in hot pursuit.
				Unable to go into lightspeed, Han sought refuge in an asteroid field,
				where he made frantic repairs -- but the hyperdrive failed again. Han
				used every trick known to Corellians to escape and limp to the nearby
				star system of Bespin, where Lando’s techs fixed the Falcon. Lando
				didn’t know the Imperials -- who encased Han in carbonite in Cloud City
				-- had deactivated her hyperdrive as a safeguard against escape
				attempts, but fortunately R2-D2 discovered the sabotage. The little
				droid reactivated the hyperdrive, allowing the freighter and her crew to
				escape.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lando and Chewbacca discovered Boba Fett had taken Han to Tatooine, and
				hid the Falcon while they infiltrated Jabba the Hutt’s palace to rescue
				their friend. Han then lent his beloved ship to Lando for the Rebel
				attack on the second Death Star at Endor. The Falcon maneuvered like a
				fighter in the chaotic battle, diving into the battle station’s
				labyrinthine superstructure. Lando fired concussion missiles into the
				Death Star’s main reactor and raced for the surface, escaping just as
				the station exploded. The lowly freighter, once derided as a piece of
				junk, had destroyed the Empire’s greatest weapon.
			</p>
			<h3><i>The First Order</i></h3>
			<p>
				After her star turn at the Battle of Endor, the Millennium Falcon was
				part of several key New Republic victories over the Empire’s remnants –
				and further semi-legal adventures pursued by Han and Chewie. But the duo
				lost their beloved freighter to Gannis Ducain, and spent years trying to
				find her again. Meanwhile, the Falcon kept changing hands, going from
				Ducain to the Irving Boys before winding up under a tarp on Jakku.
			</p>
			<p>
				Han and Chewie reclaimed the Falcon, but Han died shortly after getting
				to see his beloved ship again. Chewie and the scavenger Rey – who’d
				stolen the Falcon from Unkar Plutt on Jakku – then piloted the freighter
				into the Unknown Regions on a quest to find Luke Skywalker. After Rey
				left Ahch-To, the Falcon – now home to nests of porgs – served as an
				escape craft for the besieged Resistance on Crait.
